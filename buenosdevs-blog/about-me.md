# About Me

Hello there! I'm Augusto, the author of this blog, nice to see you here! ðŸ¤“ðŸ‘‹

Let me take a moment to introduce myself and share a bit about my background. I graduated in Information Systems from EACH-USP and earned a Masterâ€™s degree in Software Engineering from POLI-USP. As a software engineer, I've had the opportunity to actively participate and in several projects. This has allowed me to develop solid expertise in multiple programming languages, frameworks, and software architectures. I specialise in event-driven architectures and microservices. I have a strong proficiency in object-oriented programming and extensive knowledge of AWS services.

In my previous roles, I have held the positions of Technical Lead and Feature Lead. These positions have allowed me to lead and contribute to activities such as requirements elicitation, architecture definition, and collaboration with internal and external teams. Assuming these responsibilities helped me hone my leadership skills and foster effective teamwork.

Outside of code, Iâ€™m a history enthusiast. I love diving into the past, discovering ancient civilisations, and tracing the footsteps of remarkable figures. Whether itâ€™s the pharaohs of Egypt or the Roman Empire, history captivates me. To unwind, I enjoy the challenge of learning new things and I'm currently working my way up to playing the acoustic guitar.

Thank you for taking the time to get to know me better. I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to share my experiences and insights with you here on my blog.
