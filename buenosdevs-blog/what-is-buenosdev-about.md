# What Is BuenosDev About?

BuenosDev is a project created with the intention of sharing the knowledge I acquired through my studies and research on software with professional colleagues in the sector.

My main goal with this project is to share my insights, references from researchers and authors on topics of software development, cloud computing, architecture, etc., to help other people who are studying the same subjects, offering a starting point or helping them to solidify their knowledge.
